First You need Java 5 or 6.
Getting Java depends on your operating system.
for Ubuntu/Debian install sun-java6-jre package.

Second you need Google App Engine SDK for Java.
This will let you run a local server for testing your app and also nice tool for deploying it to google servers.
Get it here http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
and unpack the archive in a convenient location on your hard drive.

Add it to your path. here is mine: 
APPENGINE_HOME=/home/oren/misc/apps/appengine-java-sdk-1.3.8
PATH=$PATH:$APPENGINE_HOME/bin

Now we can create our sinatra app.
install jruby. the easiest way is via rvm. 
read about rvm here if you haven't heard about it.
after you have rvm run this:
rvm install jruby-1.5.3
gem install google-appengine

appcfg is a utility for creating applications. let's name our app contacts
appcfg.rb generate_app contacts

dev_appsever will run our app in a local server
dev_appserver.rb contacts

point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and hopefuly you see the text hello.
well done! now let's upload our app to the cloud.
